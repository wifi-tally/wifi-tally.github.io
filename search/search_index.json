Is the Tally really powered? Is your battery pack empty? Could the connector cable be broken? Did you upload all files to the Tally? Is the LED strip correctly wired? Is the LED strip working? Try to connect it to a 5V power source directly. Are you using an LED strip with common cathode? Connect the common pin to GND and do the necessary configuration . Is the NodeMCU working? Try to connect to it via USB In case you are developing the Tally Code: It is normal the strip stays black, because the init.lua file is not uploaded. The LED strip started flashing blue for a while but then turned black \u00b6 The Tally should usually recover from any errors and reboot automatically.

So this could be totally normal. The Tally slowly blinks blue for an extended amount of time \u00b6 This indicates issues when trying to connect to your WiFi. It is perfectly normal to see this during boot up for a few seconds, but it should not sustain for long. Is your WiFi up? Is the signal strong enough near the tally?

The Tally blinks blue quickly for an extended amount of time \u00b6 This means the Tally has connected to your WiFi and is waiting to get an IP address. It is perfectly normal to see this during boot up for a seconds, but it should not sustain for long. This very likely points to an issue with your WiFi configuration. Does your WiFi run DHCP? Are there enough free addresses that your WiFi router could issue? The Tally blinks blue twice \u00b6 This indicates that the Tally can not connect to the hub. Is the hub running? Is the hubs IP correctly configured in tally-settings.ini ? Did the IP address of the computer running the hub change? Could there be a firewall blocking traffic between the Tally and the hub?

Did you flash the tally-settings.ini on the Tally? Does the tally-settings.ini include all mandatory settings? Try configuring \"wrong\" settings that won't work. But this way, you should get a different error and rule out that keys where mistyped. The Tally blinks blue occasionally \u00b6 This indicates that the tally is connected to the hub, but the hub does not know which signal the tally should show. Did the hub connect to your Video Mixer? The colors on the LEDs are messed up \u00b6 Is the wiring correct? It is not unheared of, that the pins of LEDs are not labeled correctly. Maybe switch them around.

You do not need any prior experience with hardware projects as this is really beginner friendly. Info Please note that this is the Getting Started Guide, and we follow one opinionated path here. We don't want to confuse new readers with too many options and alternate paths to choose from. If you are curious about alternatives, check out details in the reference . Requirements \u00b6 You need a few parts to build the WiFi Tally. a NodeMcu ESP8266 \u00b6 This is an ESP8266 wifi chip on a development board that is typically used for IoT applications. As it is an Open Hardware project there are lots of different boards available. They mostly differ in price and form factor and are all fit for the project. But they all look similar to this: \"NodeMCU Amica\" by \"Make Magazin DE\", CC-BY-SA-4.0 !TODO: elaborate on different NodeMCUs! a piece of RGB LED strip \u00b6 It needs to be specified for 5V and have a common anode. Most LED strips that can be separated after every LED and have 4 pins should fulfill that requirement. I recommend taking one with 120LEDs per meter to not have the LEDS be spaced too much. an USB power source \u00b6 The whole setup draws far less than 200mA and can be powered via USB. Some cameras have USB outlets that you can use 200mA is little enough that even the smallest power bank can supply the Tally for hours use any old USB charger Connect the hardware \u00b6 All you need to do is connecting the LED strip to the NodeMCU board. Warning Do not connect more than 5 LEDs to the board! This will drain too much current through the board and potentially damaging it. board PIN strip PIN D3 B D2 R D1 G 3V3 + or +5V Info It is possible to connect the +5V pin of the LED strip to Vin on the board. But not all NodeMCU boards connect the PIN to the USB power supply and your LEDs would stay dark. It might also happen that you LED Strip does not work with a lower voltage of the 3.3V output. Typically this does not happen, but it could if you have an older strips. This is how the setup could look like on a breadboard. Separate Operator and Stage Light \u00b6 You can connect a second strip to use as an indicator for the speaker on stage. Connect the first LED as above and direct it in the direction of the camera operator. Then connect a second strip and let it face to the front of the camera. board PIN strip PIN D7 B D6 R D5 G 3V3 + or +5V This light will only show preview and live states, but not any error states. Prepare the NodeMCU Toolchain \u00b6 The NodeMCU documentation very nicely explains all the steps necessary to start a NodeMCU project . The documentation might seem overwhelming at first, but you only need to care of the two steps Flash Firmware, and Upload code Depending on your Operating System, you should select one \u2013 and only one \u2013 tool for each of these steps from the table . So either select NodeMCU PyFlasher or esptool.py to flash the firmware and follow their installation instruction. Similarly select ESPlorer or NodeMCU Tool to upload code and follow their installation instruction. Flash the firmware \u00b6 When everything is set up flash the firmware with the tool selected in the previous step. The firmware is the .bin file in the firmware folder. Upload Code \u00b6 Use the tool you have selected to upload the following files from the tally folder to the NodeMCU board: every file ending in .lc init.lua the tally-settings.ini described below tally-settings.ini This file configures your Tally. You can copy tally-settings.ini.example over and edit it as needed. setting name description station.ssid The name of the WiFi that the Tally should connect to station.password The password to connect to the WiFi. If the WiFi has no password, leave it empty. hub.ip The IP address the hub is running on tally.name How you want this tally to be labeled in the hub. This name needs to be unique amongst all tallies in your network. It must not be longer than 26 characters. Use of ASCII characters is recommended. For a list for all configuration values see tally-settings.ini Reference . Reboot the NodeMCU board by pressing the RST button on the board or disconnecting it from power briefly. Success If the LED strip starts blinking blue, this means you have correctly connected the hardware, flashed the firmware and uploaded the code. After a few seconds it should show up in the Hub. Configure a channel there and the WiFi Tally should follow it. Well done! Info If you run into problems, the Troubleshooting Guide should have you covered. Conclusion \u00b6 This concludes the Getting Started Guide .

But not all NodeMCU boards connect the PIN to the USB power supply and your LEDs would stay dark. It might also happen that you LED Strip does not work with a lower voltage of the 3.3V output.
